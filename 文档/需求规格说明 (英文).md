### 2.1 Business Requirements

BR1: After 2 months of system investment, the user satisfaction will have reached 70%.

BR2: After 2 months of system investment, the total amount of user transactions will have reached 40000-50000.

### 2.2 Project function

SF1: Recommend available funds and provide their details to users .

SF7: Master administrators' changes and authorizations. 

### 2.3 User Characteristics

|  User  | Characteristics  |
| :----: | :---: |
| Investors | The entire system is geared toward a large number of fund investors who use the system to obtain information on available funds and get recommendations for optimal fund portfolios. Through the system, they will choose the fund they want to buy, obtain the optimal fund portfolio, input the investment amount, and finally use the payment method provided by the system to purchase or redeem the fund. They can also monitor the income of purchased funds in real time through the system. At the same time, their computer operation skills are inconsistent. They may be in the process of misoperation due to unfamiliarity with the system. I hope the system can help them avoid these problems as much as possible. |
| Administrator | There are 1 or more administrators for the entire system. They need to add, delete, and change the fund portfolio when the fund portfolio changes. They need to master the information of user login, prohibit users from malicious login, and freeze the improper operation of the account. |
| The Main Administrator | The entire system has a main administrator, his job is to deal with changes in the administrator's information, add, delete, and change the administrator |

### 2.4 Constraint

CON1: The system uses a graphical interface

CON2: The system client runs on a WIN XP/7/8/10 or macOS or Android or IOS operating system browser, and the server runs on the Linux operating system.

CON3 : Projects are developed using a continuous integration approach

CON4: In development, developers are required to submit software requirements specification documents, test documentation, and user manuals.
